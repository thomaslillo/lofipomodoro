            For all my homies out there with brains trained by Google to watch every youtube video we see as soon as we hit the website. This is a place where you can get your lofi 
            fix in for doing the pomodoro method of studying without the distraction of seeing other youtube videos. No more fooling around with a seperate timer and music, the less 
            friction between you and a session the more you can get done. Now go learn (or buy me a coffee below).

        <p>Inspired by this excellent timer: <a href="https://pomofocus.io/">pomofocus.io</a>.</p>

    <h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>

    <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes 
    in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.

    <div class="list">
        <p>The original technique has six steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Decide on the task to be done.</li>
            <li>Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).</li>
            <li>Work on the task.</li>
            <li>End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5â€“10 minutes).[5]</li>
            <li>If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.</li>
            <li>After three pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (typically 20 to 30 minutes). Once the long break is finished, return to step 2.</li>
        </ol>
